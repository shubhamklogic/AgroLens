# Backend Module – AgroLens 🌾

This folder contains the core backend logic for the AgroLens application.  
The backend serves as the central hub, connecting the mobile frontend with AI prediction models and external environmental data.


## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

- **API Management:** Developing and maintaining RESTful endpoints for mobile communication.
- **Input Processing:** Parsing and validating JSON data sent by farmers (crop type, location).
- **Model Integration:** Connecting Random Forest and XGBoost models to the live application.
- **Advisory Logic:** Generating actionable farming advice based on model outputs.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Flask (Micro-web framework)  
- **Communication:** JSON-based REST API  
- **Testing:** Python Requests library & test_api.py script  


## 📂 Project Structure

- JSON Standardization: Integrated jsonify to ensure data compatibility with mobile frontends.

### Progress Update: 20/01/26

- POST Method: Transitioned /predict to accept POST requests for secure data handling.
- Request Parsing: Integrated flask.request to extract JSON payloads like crop type.
- Automated Testing: Built test_api.py to verify backend responses independently of the browser.

### Progress Update: 21/01/26
- Dummy ML Logic: Implemented if-else decision blocks to simulate crop yield predictions.
- Advisory Layer: Added crop-specific agricultural recommendations to the API output.

### Progress Update: 22/01/26
