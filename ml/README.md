# Machine Learning Module – AgroLens

This folder contains the machine learning components of the AgroLens application.

The ML module is responsible for:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training crop yield prediction models
- Evaluating model performance
- Generating predictions for the application
- Supporting explainable AI for better model understanding

## Responsibilities
- Dataset cleaning and preparation
- Model training, testing, and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis and explainability
- Exporting trained models for backend integration

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Notes
- Public and government datasets are used for training
- APIs are used only during data collection and training phase
- Trained models are stored locally and used offline for prediction

## Maintained By
Gopal (Data & ML Lead)
