# Machine Learning Module – AgroLens

This folder contains the machine learning components of the AgroLens application.

The ML module is responsible for:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training crop yield prediction models
- Evaluating model performance
- Generating predictions for the application
- Supporting explainable AI for better understanding

## Responsibilities
- Dataset cleaning and preparation
- Model training and testing
- Feature importance and explainability
- Exporting trained models for backend use

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Notes
- Public and government datasets are used
- APIs are used only during data collection and training
- Trained models are used offline in the application

## Maintained By
Gopal (Data & ML Lead)
