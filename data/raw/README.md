# Prototype Dataset – Wheat Yield (Jaipur District)

This directory contains a small, representative dataset used for
developing and testing the baseline machine learning prototype.

## Scope
- Crop: Wheat
- Region: Jaipur district, Rajasthan
- Granularity: Yearly
- Time span: 2013–2022

## Features
- rainfall_mm: Annual rainfall (mm)
- avg_temp_c: Average growing-season temperature (°C)
- soil_ph: Average regional soil pH

## Target
- yield_kg_per_ha: Crop yield in kilograms per hectare

## Data Status
The current dataset is a **prototype placeholder dataset** created to
validate the machine learning pipeline and modeling approach.

Values are **representative** and do not yet reflect fully integrated
official government data. In subsequent iterations, this dataset will
be replaced or augmented with validated data sourced from government
and public datasets.

## Purpose
This dataset enables rapid prototyping and baseline model development
prior to full-scale data collection and preprocessing.
